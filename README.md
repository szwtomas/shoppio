Practice e-commerce

**Author**: Tom√°s Szwarcberg

## About

User is able to:

- Search for items filtering by category
- Add products to cart, as much as the remaining stock for every specific item
- Visualize how many items the cart has, and total price
- Order the products, providing contact information.

Every order must update the available stock on ordered products.
Orders are posted on Firestore a collection
Products data such as name, remaining stock, price are fetched from Firebase.

## Implementation

This application uses ReactJS with create-react-app for the front-end, and Firebase as back-end service, particullary Firestore database.

### Routing

React Router v6 is the choice for routing. This routes render the following components:

- **"/"** renders ItemListContainer, which shows all the products avaliable.
- **"/category/:category"** also renders ItemListContainer, but now filtering by _category_ parameter, displating only products whose categories match.
- **"/detail/:productId"** renders ItemDetailContainer. This component is in charge of fetching information such as title, price, image, and so on for displaying details of product with id matching the parameter _productId_
- **"/cart"** renders Cart component, showing all the added products, amount and prices to the cart with its total price. It also links to checkout allowing user to proceed to checkout.
- **"/checkout"** renders Checkout component, displaying the form where user provides contact information and confirms the order.
- **"/ordercompleted"** renders OrderCompleted component, simply leting the user know that the order was posted succesfully and linking to _"/"_

### State Managment

State managment is implemented with react built-in Context. CartContext provides all the items added to the cart, as well as functions such as addToCart, clearCart, itemInCart, etc.

### API

All backend interaction is implemented in _index.js_ file in _service/firestore_ directory, in order to keep all the firebase imports separeted from the ui.
This module is the interface for using and fetching all firebase/firestore data.

### Miscellaneous

FontAwesome V5 is the choice for icons, but using the CDN instead of installing react-icons dependency.
